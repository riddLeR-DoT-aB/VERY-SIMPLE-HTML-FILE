<blockquote>SALUTATIONStoLordGaneshawhoisBrahmanHimself,whoistheSupremeLord,
who is the energy of Lord Shiva, who is the source of all bliss,and who is
the bestower of all virtuous qualities and success in all undertakings.
Mushikavaahana modaka hastha, Chaamara karna vilambitha sutra,
Vaamana rupa maheshwara putra, Vighna vinaayaka paada namasthe
MEANING: “O Lord Vinayaka! the remover of all obstacles, the son of
Lord Shiva, with a form which is very short, with mouse as Thy vehicle,
with sweet pudding in hand, with wide ears and long hanging trunk, I
prostrate at Thy lotus-like Feet!”Ganesh Chaturthi is one of the most
popular of Hindu festivals. This is the birthday of Lord Ganesha. It is
the day most sacred to Lord Ganesha. It falls on the 4th day ofthe bright
fortnight of Bhadrapada (August-September). It is observed throughout
India, as well as by devoted Hindus in all parts of the world.
Clay figures of the Deity are made and after beingworshipped fortwo days,
or in some cases ten days, they are thrown into water.                       </blockquote>

<blockquote>         GANESH CHATURTHIat the moon on this day, then the only way
he can be freed from the curse is by repeating or listening to the story
of how Lord Krishna cleared His character regarding the Syamantaka
jewel. This story is quoted in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Lord Ganesha was
pleased to ordain thus. Glory to Lord Ganesha! How kind and merciful
the right to be the elder. Subramanya flew off at once on his vehicle,
the peacock, to make a circuit of the world. But the wise Ganesha went,
in loving worshipfulness, around His divine parents and asked for the
prize of His victory.Lord Shiva said, “Beloved and wise Ganesha! But how
can I give you the prize; you did notgo around the world?”Ganesha replied,
“No, but I have gone around my parents. My parents represent the entire
manifesteduniverse!”Thus the dispute was settledin favour of Lord Ganesha,
 who was thereafter acknowledged as the elder of the two brothers. Mother
Parvati also gave Him a fruit as a prize for this victory.In the Ganapathi
Upanishad, Ganesha is identified with the Supreme Self. The legends that
are connected with Lord Ganesha are recorded in the Ganesha Khanda
of the Brahma Vivartha Purana.                                            </blockquote>
<blockquote>        On the Ganesh Chaturthi day, meditate on the stories connected
with Lord Ganesha early in the morning, during the Brahmamuhurta
period. Then, after taking a bath, goto the temple and do the prayers
of Lord Ganesha. Offer Him some coconut and sweet pudding. Pray
with faith and devotion that He may remove all the obstacles that you
experience on the spiritual path.Worship Him at home, too. You can get
the assistance of a pundit. Have an image of Lord Ganesha in your house.
Feel His Presence in it.Don’t forget not to look at the moon on that day;
remember that it behaved unbecomingly towards the Lord. This really
means avoid the company of all those who have no faith in God, and
who deride God, your Guru and religion, from this very day.                </blockquote>
<blockquote>      Take fresh spiritual resolves and pray to Lord Ganesha for inner
spiritual strength to attain success in all your undertakings.
May the blessings of Sri Ganesha be upon you all! May He remove all
 the obstacles that stand in your spiritual path! May He bestow on you
all material prosperity as well as liberation!                             </blockquote>
