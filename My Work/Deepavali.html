<i><blockquote>DEEPAVALI or Diwali means “a row of lights”.It falls on the last two
 days of the dark half of Kartik (October-November). For some 
it is a three-day festival. It commences with the Dhan-Teras, 
on the 13th day of the dark half of Kartik, followed the next 
commemoratesthatblesseddayonwhichthetriumphantLord
RamareturnedtoAyodhyaafter defeating Ravana. On this day also 
Sri Krishna killed the demon Narakasura.
In South India people take an oil bath in the morning and wear new 
clothes. They partake of sweetmeats. They light fireworks which are 
regarded as theeffigies of Narakasura who was killed on this day. 
They greet one another, asking, “Have you had your Ganges bath?”
which actually refers to the oil bath that morning as it is regarded as 
purifying as a bath in the holy Ganges.        </blockquote>
<blockquote>             Everyone forgets and forgives the wrongs done by others. 
There is an air of freedom, festivity and friendliness everywhere. This 
festivalbrings about unity. It instils charity in the hearts of people. 
instituted this custom must have cherished the hope that their 
descendents would realise its benefits and make it a regular habit in 
their lives.                                                      </blockquote>
<blockquote>                In a happy mood of great rejoicing village folk move about 
freely, mixing with one another without any reserve, all enmity being 
forgotten. People embrace one another with love. Deepavali is a great
 unifying force. Those with keen inner spiritual ears will clearly hear 
the voice of the sages, “OChildrenofGod!unite,andloveall”.The 
vibrationsproduced by the greetings of love which fill the atmosphere 
are powerful enough to bring about a change of heart in every man 
and woman in the world. Alas! That heart has considerably hardened, 
and only a continuous celebration of Deepavali in our homes can 
rekindle in us the urgentneed of turning away from the ruinous path
of hatred.On this day Hindu merchants in North India open their new
account books and pray for success and prosperity during the coming 
year. The homes are cleaned and decorated by day.                     </blockquote>

<blockquote>       O Ram! The light of lights, the self-luminous inner light of the 
Self is ever shining steadily in the chamber of your heart. Sit quietly. 
Close your eyes. Withdraw the senses. Fix the mind on this supreme light 
and enjoy the real Deepavali, by attaining illumination of the soul.He 
who Himself sees all but whom no one beholds, who illumines the 
intellect, the sun, the moon and the stars and the whole universe but 
whom they cannot illumine, He indeed is Brahman, He is the 
inner Self. Celebrate the real Deepavali by living in Brahman, 
of ignorance. O man! wake up from the slumber of ignorance. Realise 
the constant and eternal light of the Soul which neither rises nor sets, 
through meditation and deep enquiry.                                   </blockquote>
<blockquote>        May you all attain full inner illumination! May the supreme 
light of lights enlighten your understanding! May you all attain the 
inexhaustible spiritual wealth of the Self! May you all prosper 
gloriously on the material as well as spiritual planes!                </blockquote>
