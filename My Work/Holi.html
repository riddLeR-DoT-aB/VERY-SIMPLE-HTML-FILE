<blockquote>IN DAYS of yore, there were communities of cannibals in India.
They caused much havoc. They threatened the lives of many innocent
people.One of them was Holika or Putana. She took immense delight
in devouring children. Sri Krishna destroyed her and thus saved the
little children.Even today, the effigy or figure of Holika is burnt in 
the fire. In South India, the clay figure of Cupid is burnt.              </blockquote>
<blockquote>This is the origin of the great festival of Holi.
It begins about ten days before the full moon of the month Phalgun,
but is usually only observed for the last three or four days,terminating
with full moon.This is the spring festival of the Hindus. In the spring
season alltrees are filled withsweet-smelling flowers.                    </blockquote>
<blockquote>They all proclaim the glory and everlasting beauty of God.
They inspire you with hope, joy and a new life.
Stir you on to find out the creator and the Indweller, who is hiding
Himself in these forms.Holi is known by the name of Kamadahana in
South India, the day on which Cupid was burnt by Lord Siva.               </blockquote>

<blockquote>GURU PURNIMA Another legend has it that once upon a time an old 
woman’s grandchild was to be sacrificed to a female demon named 
Holika.A Sadhu advised that abuse and foul language would subdue 
Holika.The old woman collected many children and made them abuse
Holi in foul language.The demon fell dead on the ground.                   </blockquote>

<blockquote>The children then made a bonfire of her remains.Connected to this 
legend of the demon Holika is Bhakta Prahlad’s devotion to  Narayana, 
and his subsequent escape from death at the hands of Holika. 
Prahlad’s father, Hiranyakashipu, punished him in a variety of ways to 
change his devotional mind and make him worldly-minded.
He failed in his attempts.At last he ordered his sister, Holika, who had 
his
nephew. The niece applies coloured powder on her aunt’s face.
 Brothers and sisters and cousins play with one another.
Huge bundles of wood are gathered and burnt at night, 
and everywhere one hears shouts of “Holi-ho! Holi-ho!” 
People stand in the streets and sprinkle coloured water on any man 
who passes by,behearichmanoranofficer.
There is no restrictionont his day.
It is like theAprilFool’s Day of the Europeans. 
People compose and sing special Holi songs.
On the festival day, people clean their homes, 
remove all dirty articles from around the house and burn them. 
Disease-breeding bacteria are thereby destroyed. 
The sanitary condition of the locality is improved.                        </blockquote> 
<blockquote>During the festival, boys dance about in the streets. 
People play practical jokes with passers-by. 
A bonfire is lit towards the conclusion of the festival. 
Games representing the frolics of the young Krishna take place
joyously around a fire.On the last day of Holi, people take a little
fire fromt his bonfire tot he irhomes.
Theybelieve that their homes will be rendered pure, and 
theirbodies free from disease.Nowadays, people are found indulging 
These evils should be totally eradicated.
Festivals like Holi have their own spiritual value.
Apart from the various amusements, they create faith in God if 
properly observed. Hindu festivals always have a spiritual 
significance. They wean man away from sensual pleasures and 
take him gradually to the spiritual path and divine                         </blockquote>
