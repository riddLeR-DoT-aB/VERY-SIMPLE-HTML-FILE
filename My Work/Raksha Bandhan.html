<blockquote>RAKSHA BANDHAN is called Avani Avittam in South India. 
This falls on the full moon day of the month of Sravan (August-
September).It is an important Hindu festival.                          </blockquote>
<blockquote>      This is a festival that falls on the brightest night of Shravan month.Raksha Bandhan stirs up one of the deepest and noblest emotions - the abiding and chaste bond of love between the brother and the sister. On this day sisters tie a rakhi — which may be a colorful thread, a simple bracelet, or a decorative string — around the wrist of their brother(s). The word "raksha" signifies protection, and "bandhan" is an association signifying an enduring bond; and so, when a woman ties a rakhi around the wrist of her brother, she signifies her loving attachment to him. He, likewise, recognizes the special bond between them, and by extending his wrist forward, he in fact extends the hand of his protection over her.             </blockquote>
<blockquote>The followers of the four different Vedas have their Upakarmam
 on different days.                                                    </blockquote>

<blockquote>      On this day, Sachi, the consort of Indra, tied a holy thread or 
amulet around the wrist of Indra, when he was defeated by the 
demons. Then Indra, the king of gods, gained victory over the 
demons by the power of this protection (Raksha means 
“protection”) and recovered the lost city of Amaravati.

Tena twaam anubadhnaami rakshey maa chala maa chala.
“IamtyingonyourhandthisRaksha,with which the most powerfu land
 don’t go away.” The power of this Mantra protects the wearer from 
evil influences.                                                       </blockquote>      </b></p>
